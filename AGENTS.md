# AGENTS.md — dala_dev

You're in **dala_dev**, the build/deploy/devices toolkit for the dala ecosystem. This repository contains Mix tasks and supporting modules that handle:
- Building and deploying Elixir/OTP applications to mobile devices
- Discovering and managing connected Android and iOS devices
- Running emulators and simulators
- Provisioning development certificates and profiles
- Cross-compiling OTP releases for mobile platforms
- Performance benchmarking and battery profiling on devices
- Cluster visualization and distributed tracing

**Important**: Read [`~/code/dala/docs/reference/AGENTS.md`](../dala/docs/reference/AGENTS.md) first for the system-wide view, the three-repo topology (dala, dala_dev, dala_new), and the cross-cutting pre-empt-failure rules that apply across all repositories. The notes below are dala_dev-specific conventions and gotchas.

**Dala v0.7.x** introduces a plugin architecture where Dala core knows almost nothing — plugins self-describe through schema, commands, and native capabilities. See the `Dala.Plugin` section below. New in this version: GPU render surface with compute shaders, media runtime (video, scene graph, GPU filters, GPU processor), ML stack (Nx, EMLX, CoreML, ONNX, Burn with serving/training, GPU inference), expanded platform APIs (Clipboard, Share, Location, Notify, Diag, PubSub, Registry, Permissions, LiveView), NFC, screen manager, adaptive theming, a comprehensive two-layer testing model (render tree + native UI), Spark DSL with transformers, and new facade modules (Dala.Component, Dala.ComponentServer, Dala.ComponentRegistry, Dala.Diff, Dala.List, Dala.Event, Dala.PubSub, Dala.Native NIF fallbacks).

### Release Engineering (`scripts/release/`)

The **release tooling** directory contains shell scripts that:
1. Cross-compile OTP for target platforms:
   - Android arm64 and arm32 (using NDK toolchain)
   - iOS simulator (x86_64 and arm64)
   - iOS device (arm64)
2. Stage compiled tarballs with metadata
3. Upload releases to GitHub Releases

**Patches for OTP**: iOS device builds require source patches in `scripts/release/patches/`:
- `forker_start` skip — Avoids fork issues on iOS
- EPMD `NO_DAEMON` guard — Prevents EPMD daemonization on iOS

See `build_release.md` for the complete release walkthrough with step-by-step instructions.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

TDD is the standard practice in this repository. This ensures reliability across platforms and makes refactoring safer.

### Testing Strategy

- **Write tests first**: Before implementing a new function or fixing a bug, write a test that captures the expected behavior
- **Test alongside code**: For simple changes, write tests in the same working session
- **Every function needs tests**: Public API functions, parsing logic, and platform-specific code paths all need coverage
- **Keep the suite green**: All tests must pass before merging. A failing test is a blocker.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run the full test suite
mix test

# Run only unit tests (skip integration tests that need devices)
mix test --exclude integration

# Run a specific test file
mix test test/path/to/test_file.exs

# Run tests matching a pattern
mix test --only describe:"feature name"
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests (tagged with `@tag :integration`) require connected devices or running emulators. These are excluded by default in CI and during development unless explicitly enabled.

## Gotchas and Common Pitfalls

These are issues that have caused problems in the past. Learn from our mistakes to avoid wasting time debugging them again.

### 1. Compile-time Regex Literals (Elixir 1.19 / OTP 28.0+)

**Problem**: Regex literals in module attributes or function heads are compiled at compile time, which can cause issues with certain OTP versions. OTP 28.0 removed `:re.import/1` which compile-time `~r//` literals depend on.

**Solution**: Always use runtime compilation with `Regex.compile!("...", "flags")` or `DalaDev.Utils.compile_regex/2` for dynamic or potentially problematic patterns.

**Status**: Already fixed in 0.3.17, but easy to reintroduce. 71 literals were swept in that release. Don't use `~r{...}` syntax for patterns that might be problematic.

```elixir
# ❌ DON'T — compile-time regex
@pattern ~r/foo.*bar/

# ✅ DO — runtime compilation
@pattern Regex.compile!("foo.*bar", "")

# ✅ DO — centralized utility
@pattern DalaDev.Utils.compile_regex("foo.*bar")
```

### 2. Device ID Resolution in `mix dala.deploy`

**Problem**: When deploying with `--device <id>`, the system must resolve the device ID through discovery before deciding which platform to build for.

**Key function**: `DalaDev.NativeBuild.narrow_platforms_for_device/2`

**Why it matters**: This function is the **single source of truth** for both:
- Determining build targets (which platforms to compile for)
- Validating deployment targets (which devices are valid)

**Consequence of bypassing**: If you skip this function:
- Deploy: You'll get spurious "No device matched" warnings
- Build: You'll build for the wrong platform (e.g., building iOS when you need Android)

**Rule**: Always call `narrow_platforms_for_device/2` when resolving device IDs.

### 3. Xcodebuild Error Diagnostics

**Problem**: `xcodebuild` produces cryptic error messages that are hard to interpret.

**Solution**: `DalaDev.Provision.diagnose_xcodebuild_failure/1` rewrites Apple's errors into actionable hints.

**How it works**:
- Takes raw `xcodebuild` output
- Pattern matches against known error strings
- Returns a structured hint with:
  - Apple's original error text (preserved for Google-ability)
  - Our human-friendly explanation
  - Suggested fix actions

**When to update**: Whenever you encounter a new Apple error string that isn't handled, add a new pattern match in `diagnose_xcodebuild_failure/1`.

### 4. OTP Tarball Schema Versioning

**Problem**: When we change the structure of OTP tarballs (e.g., adding new files, changing directory layout), cached downloads become invalid.

**Solution**: Bump the schema version in `DalaDev.OtpDownloader.valid_otp_dir?/2`.

**Important**: 
- **DO NOT** bump the OTP hash — that's for checksum verification
- **DO** bump the schema version — that's the knob for invalidating caches

**How it works**: `valid_otp_dir?/2` checks if a cached tarball matches the expected schema version. If the schema changes, the cache is invalidated and the tarball is re-downloaded.

### 5. Release Script Assumptions

**Problem**: The release scripts in `scripts/release/` assume a specific directory structure.

**Key assumption**: `~/code/otp` must exist with the correct cross-compile output.

**Patch application**: The patches in `scripts/release/patches/` are applied automatically by `xcompile_ios_device.sh`.

**Idempotency**: The patch application is idempotent — re-running the script is safe and won't cause issues.

**Setup**: If you're setting up a release build environment:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/code/otp
# Follow instructions in build_release.md for populating this directory
```

### 6. Default Arguments Evaluate Eagerly

**Problem**: `System.get_env("ROOTDIR", Path.expand("~/..."))` evaluates `Path.expand` *every call*, regardless of whether `ROOTDIR` is set. `Path.expand("~/...")` calls `System.user_home!()` which raises on Android (no `HOME` env var).

**Solution**: Use `case System.get_env(...)` or `||` instead.

```elixir
# ❌ DON'T — eager evaluation
System.get_env("ROOTDIR", Path.expand("~/otp"))

# ✅ DO — lazy evaluation
System.get_env("ROOTDIR") || Path.expand("~/otp")
```

**Reference**: Burned us once — see dala commit `d77932e`.

### 7. iOS Device Sandbox Blocks `fork()`

**Problem**: The BEAM's `forker_start` and EPMD's `run_daemon` both call fork, which is blocked by the iOS device sandbox.

**Solution**: Both are patched in our OTP cross-compile. Patches at `scripts/release/patches/`.

**Rule**: Don't undo them. These patches are essential for iOS device builds.

### 8. iOS Sim and iOS Device Are Different Build Paths

**Problem**: Sim → `ios/build.sh` (`build_ios/1` in NativeBuild). Device → `ios/build_device.sh` (`build_ios_physical/2`). These are completely different build chains.

**Solution**: When `--device <udid>` is passed, dala_dev resolves it via `IOS.list_devices/0` to know which path to take.

**Rule**: Don't shortcut — always go through device resolution to pick the right build path.

### 9. LV Port 4200 Is Global Per Device

**Problem**: Two installed Dala LV apps + one running = the second can't bind.

**Workaround**: Force-stop the squatter.

**Tracked**: `issues.md` #4 (hash bundle id into port).

### 10. `:dala_nif.log/1` for Early Startup Logging

**Problem**: `Logger` output goes to stderr and is invisible before `Dala.App.start` runs `Dala.Platform.NativeLogger.install()` (which reroutes Logger to NSLog/logcat).

**Solution**: Use `:dala_nif.log("message")` for diagnostics during early init (steps 1–4 in the Erlang bootstrap).

**Rule**: `:dala_nif.log/1` for early startup, `Logger` after `Dala.App.start`.

### 11. Android Distribution Startup Race

**Problem**: Android cannot start distribution at BEAM launch — races with hwui thread pool cause SIGABRT via FORTIFY `pthread_mutex_lock on destroyed mutex`.

**Solution**: `Dala.Connectivity.Dist.ensure_started/1` defers `Node.start/2` by 3 seconds after app startup. This is handled in the dala library.

**Also**: ERTS helper binaries (`erl_child_setup`, `inet_gethost`, `epmd`) cannot be exec'd from the app data directory (SELinux `app_data_file` blocks `execute_no_trans`). They are packaged in the APK as `lib*.so` in `jniLibs/arm64-v8a/` (gets `apk_data_file` label, which allows exec). `dala_beam.c` symlinks `BINDIR/<name>` → `<nativeLibraryDir>/lib<name>.so` before `erl_start`.

### 12. EPMD Tunneling Differences

**Problem**: iOS simulator and Android have different tunneling requirements.

**iOS simulator**: Shares the Mac's network stack — the iOS BEAM registers directly in the Mac's EPMD on port 4369. No forwarding needed.

**Android**: Separate network namespace. `dala_dev` sets up adb tunnels automatically:
```
adb reverse tcp:4369 tcp:4369   # EPMD: device → Mac (Android BEAM registers in Mac EPMD)
adb forward tcp:9100 tcp:9100   # dist:  Mac → device
```

**Port assignment**: Devices are assigned dist ports by index to avoid conflicts:
- Device 0 (Android): port 9100
- Device 1 (iOS sim): port 9101

### 13. Android Node Naming

**Problem**: Android node names include a serial suffix to distinguish multiple devices.

**Convention**:
- iOS simulator: `dala_demo_ios@127.0.0.1`
- Android: `dala_demo_android_<serial-suffix>@127.0.0.1`

**Note**: The serial suffix comes from `ro.serialno`. Multi-Android support is still pending — `MainActivity.java` does NOT yet read the `dala_dist_port` intent extra.

### 14. Struct Fields Used in Guards/Pattern-Matching Must Be Initialized

**Problem**: If a struct defines a field but doesn't set a default, code that accesses it with `socket.__dala__.changed` will fail when the field is missing.

**Solution**: Always initialize all fields in the struct definition, not just in constructor functions.

**Reference**: Burned us in `Dala.Ui.Socket` where `:changed` was only set in `new/2`.

### 15. Multi-Repo Changes Batch Together

**Problem**: A user-visible fix in dala often needs matching changes in dala_dev (build) and dala_new (template). Bumping versions without coordination produces ghost regressions.

**Rule**: Check all three repos before declaring done.

### 16. Dala Module Restructuring (Facade Pattern)

**Problem**: Dala's internal modules were restructured into sub-namespaces (e.g., `Dala.Renderer` → `Dala.Ui.Renderer`, `Dala.Socket` → `Dala.Ui.Socket`, `Dala.NativeLogger` → `Dala.Platform.NativeLogger`).

**Solution**: Top-level facade modules still exist and delegate to the new locations. Use the **facade module names** (`Dala.Screen`, `Dala.Socket`, `Dala.Renderer`, etc.) for public API calls — they still work. Use the **new sub-namespace paths** when referencing internal implementation details.

**Key mappings**:
- `Dala` — main facade (`lib/dala.ex`), delegates `assign/2` and `assign/3` to `Dala.Socket`
- `Dala.App` — app facade (`lib/dala/app.ex`), delegates to `Dala.App.App` (`lib/dala/app/app.ex`)
- `Dala.Screen` — screen facade (`lib/dala/screen.ex`), delegates to `Dala.Screen.Screen` (`lib/dala/screen/screen.ex`)
- `Dala.Socket` — socket struct + API (`lib/dala/socket.ex`); `Dala.Ui.Socket` is a deprecated type alias
- `Dala.Renderer` — renderer facade (`lib/dala/renderer.ex`), delegates to `Dala.Ui.Renderer` (`lib/dala/ui/renderer.ex`)
- `Dala.Node` — node struct (`lib/dala/node.ex`), includes `stable_id/1`, `init_id_cache/0`, `compute_layout_hash/1`, `from_map/2`, `to_map/1`
- `Dala.Test` — testing helpers (`lib/dala/test.ex`), implementation directly in the facade module (no `Dala.Test.Test` sub-module)
- `Dala.ML` — ML facade (`lib/dala/ml.ex`), implementation directly in the facade module (no `Dala.Ml.Ml` sub-module)
- `Dala.Component` → `Dala.Ui.NativeView`
- `Dala.ComponentServer` → `Dala.Ui.NativeView.Server`
- `Dala.ComponentRegistry` → `Dala.Ui.NativeView.Registry`
- `Dala.Diff` → `Dala.Ui.Diff`

- `Dala.Native` → `Dala.Platform.Native`
- `Dala.NativeLogger` → `Dala.Platform.NativeLogger`
- `Dala.Dist` → `Dala.Connectivity.Dist`
- `Dala.WiFi` → `Dala.Connectivity.Wifi`
- `Dala.Device` → `Dala.Device.Device` (with `Dala.Device.Ios` and `Dala.Device.Android` as sub-modules)
- `Dala.Bluetooth` → `Dala.Hardware.Bluetooth`
- `Dala.Haptic` → `Dala.Hardware.Haptic`
- `Dala.Scanner` → `Dala.Hardware.Scanner`
- `Dala.Biometric` → `Dala.Hardware.Biometric`
- `Dala.NFC` → `Dala.Hardware.Nfc` (new)
- `Dala.Camera` → `Dala.Media.Camera`
- `Dala.Audio` → `Dala.Media.Audio`
- `Dala.Photos` → `Dala.Media.Photos`
- `Dala.PubSub` → `Dala.Platform.PubSub`
- `Dala.Event` → `Dala.Event.Event`
- `Dala.LiveView` → `Dala.Platform.LiveView`
- `Dala.WebView` → `Dala.Ui.Embedded.Webview`
- `Dala.Motion` → `Dala.Ui.Sensor.Motion`
- `Dala.Alert` → `Dala.Ui.Feedback.Alert`
- `Dala.Theme.set/1` → `Dala.Theme.Theme.set/1`
- `Dala.Plugin` → `Dala.Plugin` (struct + behaviour, unchanged)
- `Dala.Plugin.Registry` → `Dala.Plugin.Registry` (unchanged)
- `Dala.Plugin.Lifecycle` → `Dala.Plugin.Lifecycle` (unchanged)

- `Dala.Plugin.Manifest` → `Dala.Plugin.Manifest` (unchanged)
- `Dala.Plugin.Protocol` → `Dala.Plugin.Protocol` (unchanged)
- `Dala.Plugin.Event` → `Dala.Plugin.Event` (new — typed event definitions for plugins)
- `Dala.Nav.Registry` → `Dala.Nav.Registry` (unchanged)
- `Dala.Screen.Manager` → `Dala.Screen.Manager` (new — central registry for tracking active screens)
- `Dala.Preview` → `Dala.Preview` (dev-only, in `dev_tools/`)
- `Dala.Wakelock` → `Dala.Hardware.Wakelock`
- `Dala.Storage` → `Dala.Storage.Storage`
- `Dala.Blob` → `Dala.Storage.Blob`
- `Dala.Files` → `Dala.Storage.Files`
- `Dala.Settings` → `Dala.Platform.Settings`
- `Dala.State` → `Dala.Platform.State`
- `Dala.Linking` → `Dala.Platform.Linking`

- `Dala.Location` → `Dala.Platform.Location`
- `Dala.Notify` → `Dala.Platform.Notify`
- `Dala.Video` → `Dala.Media.Video`
- `Dala.Setup` → `Dala.Setup` (BT/WiFi setup helper, unchanged)

**New facade modules** (top-level, delegate to sub-namespaces):
- `Dala` — main facade, delegates `assign/2` and `assign/3` to `Dala.Socket`
- `Dala.ML` — ML facade, implementation directly in the facade module (no `Dala.Ml.Ml` sub-module)
- `Dala.Test` — testing facade, implementation directly in the facade module (no `Dala.Test.Test` sub-module)
- `Dala.App` — app facade, delegates to `Dala.App.App` (implementation at `lib/dala/app/app.ex`)
- `Dala.Screen` — screen facade, delegates to `Dala.Screen.Screen` (implementation at `lib/dala/screen/screen.ex`)
- `Dala.Renderer` — renderer facade, delegates to `Dala.Ui.Renderer`
- `Dala.Plugin` — plugin facade, delegates to `Dala.Plugin` (struct + behaviour, unchanged)
- `Dala.Component` — component facade (`lib/dala/component.ex`), delegates to `Dala.Ui.NativeView`
- `Dala.ComponentServer` — component server facade (`lib/dala/component_server.ex`), delegates to `Dala.Ui.NativeView.Server`
- `Dala.ComponentRegistry` — component registry facade (`lib/dala/component_registry.ex`), delegates to `Dala.Ui.NativeView.Registry`
- `Dala.Diff` — diff engine facade (`lib/dala/diff.ex`), delegates to `Dala.Ui.Diff`
- `Dala.List` — list rendering facade (`lib/dala/list.ex`), delegates to `Dala.Ui.List`
- `Dala.Event` — unified event facade (`lib/dala/event.ex`), delegates to `Dala.Event.Event`
- `Dala.PubSub` — PubSub facade (`lib/dala/pubsub.ex`), delegates to `Dala.Platform.PubSub`
- `Dala.Native` — platform-native NIF fallback implementations (`lib/dala/native.ex`), provides fallback implementations for CoreML and ONNX NIF functions that return `:not_supported` on non-mobile platforms

**Rule**: When writing new code in dala_dev that references dala internals, use the new sub-namespace paths. When generating code for user projects (templates), use the facade names.

### 17. UI Render Path: Binary Protocol

**Problem**: The render pipeline now uses a custom binary protocol instead of JSON.

**Architecture**: `Dala.Ui.Renderer.render/4` encodes `Dala.Node` trees to compact binary → `Dala.Platform.Native.set_root_binary/1` NIF receives binary data.

**Binary format**: `[0xDA][0xA1][u16 version=3][u16 flags][u64 node_count] + nodes`
**Patches**: `[0xDA][0xA1][u16 version=3][u16 patch_count] + [FRAME_BEGIN][opcodes...][FRAME_END]`

**Zero-copy**: Rustler's `Binary<'a>` maps directly to BEAM off-heap binaries.

### 18. Skip Renders When Nothing Changed

**Problem**: Unnecessary renders waste CPU and cause flicker.

**Solution**: `Dala.Ui.Socket.assign/3` tracks changed keys in `__dala__.changed`. `Dala.Screen.Screen.do_render/3` skips the render if no assigns changed and no navigation occurred. `do_render/3` clears `changed` even when skipping render, preventing stale change tracking.

### 19. Incremental Rendering with Diff Engine

**Problem**: Full tree re-renders are expensive.

**Solution**: `Dala.Ui.Diff.diff/2` compares two `Dala.Node` trees and produces patches (`:replace`, `:update_props`, `:insert`, `:remove`). `Dala.Ui.Renderer.render_patches/5` sends only patches to native when supported. Falls back to full render if native doesn't support `apply_patches/1`.

### 20. Spark DSL for Declarative Screens

**Problem**: Writing `render/1` by hand is verbose.

**Solution**: `use Dala.Spark.Dsl` provides a declarative DSL that mirrors `Dala.Ui.Widgets` one-to-one. Features `@ref` syntax for assigns, auto-generated `mount/3`, and compile-time verifiers.

### 21. Zero-Config ML on iOS/Android

**Problem**: ML configuration is platform-specific and error-prone.

**Solution**: `Dala.ML.setup/0` auto-configures the ML stack:
- iOS device: EMLX with Metal GPU, JIT disabled (W^X policy)
- iOS simulator: EMLX with Metal GPU, JIT enabled
- Android: Nx.BinaryBackend

CoreML predictions are synchronous (NIF captures ObjC callback via Mutex) and run on the dirty CPU scheduler (`schedule = "DirtyCpu"`).
ONNX NIFs are also dirty CPU scheduled and available on both iOS and Android.

### 22. Bluetooth/WiFi Setup

**Problem**: Bluetooth and WiFi permissions setup is platform-specific and tedious.

**Solution**: Runtime helpers: `Dala.Setup.check_bluetooth/0`, `Dala.Setup.check_wifi/0`, `Dala.Setup.diagnostic/0`.

### 23. Plugin Lifecycle and Capability Registration

**Problem**: Plugins need a structured lifecycle with dependency ordering and capability negotiation.

**Solution**: `Dala.Plugin` behaviour with `Dala.Plugin.Lifecycle` and `Dala.Plugin.Registry`:
- Lifecycle states: `:registered` → `:initialized` → `:active` → `:registered` → `:unloaded`
- `Dala.Plugin.Lifecycle` manages init/activate/deactivate/cleanup transitions
- `Dala.Plugin.Registry` handles dependency resolution (topological sort via Kahn's algorithm), capability queries, and platform filtering
- Two DSL styles: top-level declarations and `plugin do` block
- Plugins MUST declare `schema_version`, `protocol_version`, and `native_api_version`
- `Dala.Plugin.Event` provides typed event definitions with compile-time field validation and binary encoding
- Plugin macros: `component/2`, `schema_version/1`, `protocol_version/1`, `native_api_version/1`, `description/1`, `permission/1`, `dependency/1`, `platform/1`, `native_module/1`, `plugin/1` (block), `plugin_component/2`, `plugin_event/2`, `plugin_native/2`, `plugin_permission/1`, `plugin_dependency/2`, `plugin_platform/1`, `plugin_description/1`
- Generated functions: `__plugin_info__/0`, `register/0`, `component/1`, `components/0`, `components_list/0`, `capabilities/0`, `permissions/0`, `native_modules/1`, `dependencies/0`, `validate_config/1`, `handle_event/3`, `init/1`, `cleanup/1`, `generate_protocol/0`, `generate_manifest/0`, `__auto_register__/0`
- `Dala.Plugin.auto_register/0` scans all loaded applications for plugin modules and auto-registers them

**Rule**: Plugins should NEVER directly access BEAM internals, scheduler state, or raw protocol sockets. Use the Host API seam.

### 24. Dev-Only UI Preview and Design Tool

**Problem**: Developers need to preview UI without a device.

**Solution**: `Dala.Preview` (in `dev_tools/`) provides:
- Static preview — generates standalone HTML with CSS that mimics Dala's styling
- Live designer — Phoenix LiveView server with drag-and-drop component palette, property editor, live phone-frame preview, and code generation

**Key points**:
- Lives in `dev_tools/` — only compiled in `:dev` environment
- Not included in Hex package
- Code generation supports Spark DSL style

### 25. WebView Interact API

**Problem**: Programmatic control of WebView content from Elixir is needed for production use and testing.

**Solution**: `Dala.Ui.Embedded.Webview.interact/2` provides a high-level API:
- `{:tap, selector}`, `{:type, selector, text}`, `{:clear, selector}`, `{:eval, js_code}`, `{:scroll, selector, dx, dy}`, `{:wait, selector, timeout_ms}`
- Also: `navigate/2`, `reload/1`, `stop_loading/1`, `go_forward/1`
- Results arrive via `handle_info({:webview, :interact_result, ...})` and `handle_info({:webview, :eval_result, ...})`

### 26. Event System and Platform APIs

**Problem**: Unified event routing between native and BEAM, plus platform-specific APIs.

**Solution**:
- `Dala.Event` — unified event emission: `dispatch/4`, `emit/4`, `send_test/6`
- `Dala.Event.Bridge` — event routing between native and BEAM
- `Dala.Event.Throttle` — event throttling/debouncing
- `Dala.Event.Trace` — event tracing for debugging
- `Dala.Event.Target` — event target
- `Dala.Event.Address` — event addressing
- `Dala.Event.Component` — component-level events
- `Dala.Ui.NativeView` — stateful Elixir processes paired with platform-native views
- `Dala.Platform.Background` — background execution keep-alive
- `Dala.Platform.Linking` — open URLs, deep links
- `Dala.Platform.Settings` — persistent settings (UserDefaults/SharedPreferences)
- `Dala.Platform.State` — DETS-backed persistent key-value store
- `Dala.Platform.PubSub` — local PubSub via Elixir Registry
- `Dala.Platform.Registry` — process registry
- `Dala.Platform.Clipboard` — clipboard
- `Dala.Platform.Share` — share sheet
- `Dala.Platform.Location` — location services
- `Dala.Platform.Notify` — push notifications
- `Dala.Platform.Diag` — diagnostics

- `Dala.Connectivity.Dist` — platform-aware Erlang distribution startup
- `Dala.Setup` — BT/WiFi setup helper

### 27. Dala.Test — Two-Layer Inspection Model

**Problem**: Testing Dala apps requires both logical render tree inspection and native UI verification.

**Solution**: `Dala.Test` exposes two complementary views:
- **Render tree** (`tree/1`, `find/2`) — Dala logical components, fast, exact, has `on_tap` tags
- **Native view tree** (`view_tree/1`, `find_view/2`) — native UIView/View hierarchies via NIF
- **Accessibility tree** (`ui_tree/1`) — OS accessibility tree (requires AX activation on iOS)

**Navigation helpers** (synchronous): `pop/1`, `navigate/3`, `pop_to/2`, `pop_to_root/1`, `reset_to/3`
**Interaction helpers**: `tap/2` (by tag), `back/1` (system back), `select/3` (list row)
**Native UI helpers**: `tap_xy/3`, `type_text/2`, `swipe/5`, `ax_action/3`, `ax_action_at_xy/4`, `toggle/2`, `adjust_slider/4`, `dismiss_alert/2`, `long_press_xy/4`, `delete_backward/1`, `key_press/2`, `clear_text/1`
**WebView helpers**: `webview_eval/2`, `webview_tap/3`, `webview_type/3`, `webview_navigate/2`, `webview_reload/1`, `webview_stop_loading/1`, `webview_go_forward/1`, `webview_clear/2`, `webview_screenshot/1`, `webview_post_message/2`
**Inspection helpers**: `screen/1`, `assigns/1`, `inspect/1`, `screen_info/1`, `view_tree_flat/1`, `flatten_tree/1`, `find_native/2`, `wait_for/3`, `wait_for_text/3`
**Simulation helpers**: `send_message/2` — simulates async device API results (camera, location, notifications, permissions, etc.)
**Native gesture helpers**: `tap_native/1`, `locate/1` — drive native UI via `idb` on iOS simulator

**Rule**: Prefer `Dala.Test` over screenshots. Use render tree first for Dala apps, native tree for geometry/frames, AX tree for non-Dala content.

### 28. Dala.App screens/1 Helper

**Problem**: Screen modules need compile-time validation in navigation declarations.

**Solution**: Use `screens/1` in your app's `navigation/1` to register screen modules:
```elixir
def navigation(_) do
  screens([MyApp.HomeScreen, MyApp.SettingsScreen])
  stack(:home, root: MyApp.HomeScreen)
end
```
This validates at compile time that the modules are valid `Dala.Screen` modules.

### 29. GPU Render Surface

**Problem**: GPU rendering requires a surface lifecycle managed by a GenServer.

**Solution**: `Dala.Gpu` provides a CPU-side framebuffer uploaded to GPU every frame:
- `Dala.Gpu.create_surface/2` — creates a new GPU surface
- `Dala.Gpu.clear/2`, `Dala.Gpu.fill_rect/6`, `Dala.Gpu.draw_line/6` — render commands
- `Dala.Gpu.present/1` — flush command queue and update GPU texture
- `Dala.Gpu.dispatch_compute/4` — dispatch GPU compute shaders
- `Dala.Gpu.with_pixels/2` — direct pixel access via callback

**Sub-modules**: `Dala.Gpu.Command` (render commands), `Dala.Gpu.Surface` (GenServer), `Dala.Gpu.Compute` (compute shaders), `Dala.Gpu.Compute.Buffer` (compute buffer), `Dala.Gpu.Compute.Kernel` (compute kernel), `Dala.Gpu.Compute.Pipeline` (compute pipeline), `Dala.Gpu.Native` (native GPU interface)

**Use cases**: Custom canvas rendering, ML tensor visualization, game-like rendering, video processing, shader effects.

### 30. Media Runtime (Video, Scene Graph, GPU Filters)

**Problem**: Media playback and processing requires a pipeline architecture.

**Solution**: Dala's media runtime provides:
- `Dala.Media.Video` — video playback
- `Dala.Media.Pipeline` — media pipeline
- `Dala.Media.Scene` — scene graph
- `Dala.Media.Stream` — media streaming
- `Dala.Media.Filter` — GPU filters
- `Dala.Media.Texture` — GPU textures
- `Dala.Media.Adaptive` — adaptive bitrate
- `Dala.Media.Animation` — animations
- `Dala.Media.Clock` — media clock
- `Dala.Media.Subtitle` — subtitles

**Rule**: Media modules use the GPU surface for rendering. See the Dala library's `guides/media_runtime.md` for the complete media runtime documentation.

### 32. File Transfer Between Dev Machine and Devices

**Problem**: Developers need to move files to/from devices — fixtures, configs, assets, logs, databases — without rebuilding the app.

**Solution**: `DalaDev.FileTransfer` provides four operations across all platforms:

- **`push/3`** — copies a local file or directory to the device. On Android, folders are staged as tar archives (avoids per-file adb overhead and preserves SELinux context). On iOS Simulator, files are written directly to the app's Documents directory on the host filesystem. On iOS Physical, `xcrun devicectl` handles the transfer.
- **`pull/3`** — copies a remote file or directory to the local machine. Uses the same tar staging approach on Android for directories.
- **`sync/3`** — bidirectional directory synchronization. Compares local and remote file trees by size and mtime, then pushes new/changed local files, pulls new/changed remote files, and optionally deletes remote files not present locally. Ideal for keeping fixture directories or asset folders in sync.
- **`ls/2`** — lists files in a remote directory.

All operations support `--on_conflict` (`overwrite`, `skip`, `rename`) and `--progress` flags.

**Gotcha — Android non-rooted pull**: Pulling files from a non-rooted device requires copying from the app sandbox to `/data/local/tmp/` via `run-as`, then `adb pull` from there. The staging file is cleaned up in an `after` block to avoid leaking temp files on the device.

**Gotcha — iOS Physical delete**: `xcrun devicectl` does not support deleting files from the app container. The `sync` delete action logs a warning on iOS Physical rather than failing silently.

### 33. Permission Management

**Problem**: iOS and Android require runtime permission requests for device capabilities.

**Solution**: `Dala.Permissions` provides a unified interface:
- `Dala.Permissions.request(pid, :camera)` — request a permission (result arrives via `handle_info`)
- `Dala.Permissions.check(:camera)` — check if granted (`:granted` | `:denied`)
- `Dala.Permissions.supported_permissions/0` — list all supported permissions
- `Dala.Permissions.ios_plist_key/1` — returns the iOS plist key for a permission
- `Dala.Permissions.android_permission/1` — returns the Android permission string

**Supported permissions**: `:camera`, `:microphone`, `:bluetooth`, `:location`, `:storage`, `:photos`, `:contacts`, `:notifications`, `:nfc`

**Rule**: Always request permissions before using the corresponding device API. Use `Dala.Permissions` rather than platform-specific permission code.

## Public API Seams (Testing Interfaces)

These functions are intentionally public to enable thorough testing. They serve as "seams" where we can inject test data and verify behavior in isolation.

**⚠️ Warning**: Do **NOT** make these functions private. They are public by design to support our testing strategy.

### Why These Are Public

Many of these functions contain parsing logic or platform-specific narrowing logic that needs to be tested independently of the full deployment pipeline. By keeping them public:
- We can test parsers with known input/output pairs
- We can test platform narrowing without needing actual devices
- We can verify error handling without triggering real deployments
